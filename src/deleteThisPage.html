this is only primitive webpack helper
to load from source to bundle pictures used as backgrounds,
since webpack can only load files used as img tag, not
css bg;

<html style="display: none";>
    <body>
        <!--those files will be loaded into bundle,
        and there will be used as backgrounds-->
